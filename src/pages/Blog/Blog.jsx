                    <h1 className="font-bold text-2xl mb-3">Question: What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h1>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">Answer: An access token is a credential that is used to access protected resources or perform actions on behalf of a user or application. It serves as a proof of authentication and authorization. When a user or application successfully authenticates with a server, an access token is issued to them. This token is then included in subsequent requests to the server to access protected resources or perform authorized actions. The server validates the access token to ensure that the requester has the necessary permissions to perform the requested operation.On the other hand, a refresh token is a special token that is also issued during the authentication process. Its purpose is to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to reauthenticate. Refresh tokens have a longer lifespan than access tokens and are typically used to obtain new access tokens when the current one expires. When an access token expires, the refresh token can be sent to a designated server endpoint, and if it is valid and not expired, the server issues a new access token to the requester. <br /> Here a general overview of how they typically work:Access Token Usage: <br /> The client includes the access token in the headers or the body of subsequent requests to the server to access protected resources or perform authorized actions. The server verifies the access token validity, expiration, and permissions before granting access.Refresh Token Usage: When an access token expires or becomes invalid, the client can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token without reauthentication. The client sends the refresh token to a designated server endpoint along with the necessary credentials. If the refresh token is valid and has not expired, the server issues a new access token. <br />
                        Regarding storage on the client-side, it is crucial to follow best practices to maintain the security of tokens: <br />
                        Access Token Storage: Access tokens are typically short-lived and can be stored in memory (RAM) on the client-side. They should not be stored in long-term storage, such as cookies or local storage, as those can be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
                        Refresh Token Storage: Refresh tokens have a longer lifespan and need to be securely stored on the client-side. They are commonly stored in secure HTTP-only cookies or encrypted storage mechanisms like the operating system secure storage.</h2>

                    <h1 className="font-bold text-2xl mb-3">Question: Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h1>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">Answer: SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems, each with its own characteristics and suitable use cases. Here is a comparison of SQL and NoSQL databases: <br />
                        Data Model: <br />
                        SQL: SQL databases follow a structured, tabular data model where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas. They enforce strict data consistency and integrity through predefined relationships and constraints. <br />
                        NoSQL: NoSQL databases provide a flexible, schema-less data model. They can store data in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores. This flexibility allows for dynamic and evolving data structures.
                        <br />
                        Use Cases: <br />
                        SQL: SQL databases are well-suited for applications with structured data and complex relationships, such as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and content management systems that require strong data consistency and integrity. <br />
                        NoSQL: NoSQL databases are ideal for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, including social media platforms, real-time analytics, content repositories, and applications that prioritize scalability and high availability over strict data consistency.

                    <h1 className="font-bold text-2xl mb-3">Question: What is express js? What is Nest JS?</h1>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">Answer: Express.js: <br />
                        Express.js is a popular and widely used web application framework for Node.js. It provides a minimal and flexible set of features for building web applications and APIs. Express.js is known for its simplicity, ease of use, and robustness. <br />
                        characteristics of Express.js:
                        Web Application Framework: Express.js is a framework that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs in Node.js. It provides a set of functions and utilities for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and rendering responses.

                        Routing: Express.js allows us to define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URLs. It enables us to handle incoming requests and define the corresponding actions or middleware functions to execute. <br />
                        Express.js is widely adopted in the Node.js community and has been used to build a variety of web applications, APIs, and server-side applications. <br />

                        NestJS: NestJS is a progressive and modular web application framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications with Node.js. <br />
                        characteristics of NestJS: <br />
                        TypeScript: NestJS is built with TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript provides enhanced developer productivity, code maintainability, and improved tooling through features like type checking, interfaces, and decorators.
                        Modular Architecture: NestJS promotes a modular and organized architectural pattern for building applications. It encourages the use of modules, which encapsulate related functionality, and provides dependency injection to easily manage dependencies between different modules and components.
                        NestJS aims to provide a structured and opinionated approach to building server-side applications with Node.js while taking advantage of modern JavaScript and TypeScript features.

                    <h1 className="font-bold text-2xl mb-3">Question: What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work ?</h1>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">Answer:In MongoDB, the aggregate operation is used to perform advanced data processing and analysis on documents within a collection. It allows us to perform complex computations, transformations, aggregations, and data manipulations in a flexible and efficient manner. <br />How the aggregate operation works in MongoDB: <br />Pipeline Stages: The aggregate operation takes an array of stages as its argument. Each stage represents a specific operation or transformation to be applied to the documents in the collection. The stages are executed sequentially, with the output of each stage becoming the input for the next stage. <br />Document Processing: As the pipeline stages are executed one by one, each document in the collection is processed through the pipeline. The stages can modify or filter the documents based on the specified criteria and operations. The output of each stage becomes the input for the next stage in the pipeline. <br />The aggregate operation in MongoDB provides powerful capabilities for data manipulation and analysis. It allows us to perform complex operations that go beyond simple querying, enabling us to aggregate, transform, and derive insights from your data. </h2>
